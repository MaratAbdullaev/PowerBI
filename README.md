As part of my job I often need to explain to business users how to build a Power BI report. While Microsoft has fantastic documentation, I always missed a one-pager describing all the steps.

I first started (back at Flying Tiger Copenhagen) with Version 1 in Excel - my favorite tool for everything - even for making videos (presented at DataViz CPH ). Then came a simpler version 2 in PowerPoint. I then used Confluence for the 3rd edition in Gjensidige. And finally, I decided to do it as a flow chart. Inspired by Data Goddess of the week on Christopher Wagner,'s Kratos BI, Mara Pereira and her Power BI Report Development 101. 

This time I used Miro, the ultimate tool for whiteboard collaboration - which I mentioned in my earlier post - HAS NO CANVAS LIMITS. I needed a lot of space because I wanted bigger steps AND smaller tasks included in one-pager.
